# lizard-attention-tracker-w-idd

"w-idd" means "_with IDD_", and that means that I'm supposed to practice Issue Driven Development here. So first there should be added an issue proposing some change. Then a corresponding branch should be added. Then a change should be implemented in it. Then there should be a review and finally a pull request and merge to get that change into master.

### Attention Tracker allows to easily visually compare amount of attention required and spent on specific areas of daily life.
